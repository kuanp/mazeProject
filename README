To get started, you can either use the provided Visual Studio .sln (VS2012), or the Makefile. The Makefile provides build capability for Cygwin, Linux, or OSX operating systems.

The Makefile has been confirmed to work as-is in the Myth cluster.

VS users: in the case that you experience an error in which <glut32.dll> cannot be found, it has been included with the starter files. You should copy this file to the Debug/ and Release/ folders generated at compile time.

If you experience build problems, please make a post on Piazza or contact the staff list immediately so we can get you ready to go!
